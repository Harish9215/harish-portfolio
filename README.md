# 🌐 Harish Mohan – Personal Portfolio

Hey there! Welcome to my personal corner of the web — a portfolio site I'm actively building to showcase my journey, projects, and the things I'm passionate about.

> 🚧 **Work in Progress**  
> This portfolio is constantly evolving. I'm adding new projects, refining the design, and improving the user experience as I go. So if you notice a few unfinished touches — that’s just part of the build process!

## ⚙️ What's Under the Hood?

This site is built using a modern and minimal tech stack:

- **React** – For building a dynamic, component-driven UI  
- **Tailwind CSS (via CDN)** – Rapid utility-first styling directly from the CDN  
- **Lucide React** – Sleek, customizable icon library  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Clean, modular logic under the hood  
- **HTML5/CSS3** – The timeless foundation

## ✨ Features (Some Live, Some Coming Soon)

- 🔁 **Responsive Design** – Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile  
- 🧩 **Modular React Components** – Easier to scale and maintain  
- 🎯 **Clean Layout** – Easy to read, easy to navigate  
- 💼 **Project Showcase** – Real work, real code, real impact  
- 🛠️ **Skills Overview** – A quick look at my tech stack  
- 📫 **Contact Section** – Let's connect!
