# My Personal Portfolio (Harish Mohan)

Hey there! This is my personal corner of the internet, a portfolio website I'm actively building to showcase my journey, projects, and what I'm all about. It's a living project, always getting new bits and pieces added.

## Work in Progress! ðŸš§

Just a heads-up that this portfolio is currently a work in progress! I'm constantly tweaking things, adding new projects, and refining the design. You might see some unfinished sections or features, but I'm excited to keep building it out.

## What's Under the Hood?

I'm building this site with some awesome modern tools:

* **React:** For the core user interface â€“ keeps everything snappy and component-based.
* **Tailwind CSS (via CDN):** My go-to for styling. It's super fast for building custom designs without wrestling with traditional CSS. (Quick note: For simplicity in development, I'm pulling Tailwind directly from a CDN for now!)
* **Lucide React:** Because who doesn't love sleek, customizable icons?
* Just your standard **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript (ES6+)** bringing it all together.

## What You'll Find (or will find soon!)

* **A Responsive Design:** Looks good on phones, tablets, and desktops â€“ trying to make sure it's accessible everywhere.
* **Clean & Intuitive Layout:** Aiming for a user experience that's easy on the eyes and simple to navigate.
* **Modular Approach:** Breaking things down into reusable React components, which makes my life (and future updates!) a lot easier.
* **My Projects:** A dedicated spot to show off what I've been working on.
* **My Skills:** A quick rundown of the tech and tools I'm comfortable with.
* **How to Reach Me:** All the ways you can get in touch.

## Getting Started Locally (For Devs & Curious Minds)

Want to run this project on your own machine? Great! Hereâ€™s how:

### What You'll Need

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can grab them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Setting Up

1.  **Grab the code:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Harish9215/harish-portfolio.git](https://github.com/Harish9215/harish-portfolio.git)
    ```
2.  **Jump into the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd harish-portfolio
    ```
3.  **Install all the necessary bits:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **A quick check for Tailwind CSS:**
    Since I'm using the CDN, just double-check that this line is in your `public/index.html` file, right inside the `<head>` section. It's how all the cool Tailwind styles show up!
    ```html
    <script src="[https://cdn.tailwindcss.com](https://cdn.tailwindcss.com)"></script>
    ```

### Firing It Up!

Once everything's installed, kick off the development server:

```bash
npm start
